            Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish 
            which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, 
            in between the lasagna noodles.
